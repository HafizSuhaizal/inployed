# **InPloyed** (Job Searching System)

**INTRODUCTION**

A research done by Hossain(2018), Yagamaran(2018), Afrin(2018), Limon(2018), Nasiruzzaman(2018) & Karim(2018), has stated that the high percentage of unemployement usually occurs during the economic recession where the labour supply exceeds the demand in the market. According to the research, there are also many factors that could affect unemployement rates, such as company downsizing, changes in technology, foreign competition, and job outsourcing to other countries. It is also a well known fact that Malaysian universities, public and private higher institutions produce a large number of graduates, causing high competitions for fresh graduates and a long list of applications that are time consuming to be reviewed by the hiring companies. The competition also include job seekers, who are searching for a job that are suitable for them according to their experience and skills. In order for fresh graduates and job seekers to not miss an opportunity to apply for a job that is suitable for them and also for hiring companies to receive an applicant that suits their requirement description, We propose a Job Searching System (InPloyed) which provides a service for these applicants to search and list down company and job positions that matches their prefered working location, skills, certificates and working sectors. All the target users including the job seekers, fresh graduates and hiring companies can benefit from this system through its function to filter job position and display list of applicants.
